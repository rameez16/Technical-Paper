## 1. Introduction

 Developers often face difficulty while modifying existing code for enhancing functionality and  add new feature's.Its because adding new code to existing codebase may break code structure. A well-written code should be reusable,extendable,logical,easier to read and modify. How to device a good software design so that the code posses above mentioned qualities?.SOLID design principle effectively answer this question by coming up with five good design methods that make the code more maintainable ,testable,extendable and re-usable.following these principle will save both time and effort in maintaining and managing code.Best benefit of SOLID based design is that we can modify the code without impacting other part of the code. So let us look at each of the 5 principles in detail.Basic understanding of Object Oriented Design concept is necessary to follow this report.   




## 2. S.O.L.I.D acronym means the following:

>1. S: Single Responsibility Principle
> 2. O: Open-Closed Principle
> 3. L: Liskov Substitution Principle
 >4. I: Interface Segregation Principle
 >5. D: Dependency Inversion Principle



## 2.1.single responsibility principle

 > A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

As the name suggests the class , method or function must be designed to handle single task only.Another way of describing it would be class or function should have only one reason to change. When a class serves multiple purposes or responsibilities, it should be made into a new class.The ultimate goal of the class should be to serve single purpose only. 


Have a look at the class given below. The class 'UserSetting clearly violate the SRP principle because it handle multiple responsibility. It contains two function doing different task.one being change Setting and another verify credentials .So its a clear violation of single responsibility principle.

```javascript 
class UserSettings {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user;
  }

  changeSettings(settings) {
    if (this.verifyCredentials()) {
      // ...
    }
  }

  verifyCredentials() {
    // ...
  }
}
```
How to rewrite above class to follow SRP principle. Solution is simple and straightforward. Split the class into two each doing its own task.

```javascript
class UserAuth {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user;
  }

  verifyCredentials() {
    // ...
  }
}


class UserSettings {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user;
    this.auth = new UserAuth(user);
  }

  changeSettings(settings) {
    if (this.auth.verifyCredentials()) {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

Examine the above code.The class UserSetting has been disintegrated into two classes.      
1. UserAuth-responsible for verifyCredentials
1. UserSetting -responsible for change settings.
2. 
Thus it is re-designed to follow SRP principle. 
 


## 2.Open-close principle


> ### this principle states that the class/functions is open for extension but closed for modification
what does this statement actually imply to?. according to this principle we are allowed to extend a class for enhanced functionality.but we are never allowed to modify it.Any kind of modification on the existing class is prohibited.we cant touch existing code.what to do if we want to update the class for better functionality or we want to add a new requirement by strictly following Open-Close Principle?. It should be achieved by adding new classes , methods and attributes without modifying existing class.


lets understand this better by an example.Consider the following code.Here the developer has created a class that calculate interest for All savings account based on type of account.they are the following.

1. regular 
2. salary 
  
  
  

```JAVA Public class SavingAccount  
{  
     
    Public decimal CalculateInterest(AccountType accountType)  
    {  
        If(AccountType==”Regular”)  
        {  
            
            Interest = balance * 0.4;  
            If(balance < 1000) interest -= balance * 0.2;  
            If(balance < 50000) interest += amount * 0.4;  
        }  
        else if(AccountType==”Salary”)  
        {  
             
            Interest = balance * 0.5;  
        }  
    }  
}  
```
Now bank has revised its requirement and want to add one more account type named Student.One way to do this is to modify the current class and add one more if-else statement for student type.But this is a direct violation of OCP principle.We will be modifying the class here, which is not allowed. So how to re-design the code so that it obey OCP principle. Have a look at the classes given below.

```JAVA Interface ISavingAccount  
{   
   decimal CalculateInterest();  
}  
Public Class RegularSavingAccount : ISavingAccount  
{  
  
  Public decimal CalculateInterest()  
  {  
 
    Interest = balance * 0.4;  
    If(balance < 1000) interest -= balance * 0.2;  
    If(balance < 50000) interest += amount * 0.4;  
  }  
}  
  
Public Class SalarySavingAccount : ISavingAccount  
{  
    
  Public decimal CalculateInterest()  
  {  
   
    Interest = balance * 0.5;  
  }  
}  
```

here instead of using if else statements we have created separate class for each Account type.Now if the bank needs to add new account type say Student,Developer can add a new class Student and achieve the requirements of the bank.this is done without modifying existing class.He just extended the class for new functionality.Now the code obeys OCP principle.3. So, at any given point of time when there is a requirement change instead of touching the existing functionality it’s always suggested to create new classes and leave the original implementation untouched

what are the consequences of not following ocp?

1. testing become tedious because along with new feature we end up testing all the 
   modified classes and function again

2.  Not following OCP brakes SRP.
 
3. Maintenance become  difficult since we are adding more logic to existing class. 
   
# 3.Liskov’s Substitution Principle:

The principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 and according to this principle “Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes“. This principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior.

  You can understand it in a way that a farmer’s son should inherit farming skills from his father and should be able to replace his father if needed. If the son wants to become a farmer then he can replace his father but if he wants to become a cricketer then definitely the son can’t replace his father even though they both belong to the same family hierarchy.

        


 ```java



     public abstract class Fruit
{
    public abstract string GetColor();
}

public class Orange : Fruit
{
    public override string GetColor()
    {
        return "Orange Color";
    }
}

public class Apple : Fruit
{
    public override string GetColor()
    {
        return "Red color";
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Fruit fruit = new Orange();

        Console.WriteLine(fruit.GetColor());

        fruit = new Apple();

        Console.WriteLine(fruit.GetColor());
    }
}
  ```



# 4.Interface Segregation Principle

 Interface segregation principle states:

> ### A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use

let us better understand above statement with an example.consider the code given below. Developer created a class ISmartDevice which have the interface for print,fax and scan.

```JAVa 

interface  ISmartDevice
{
    void Print();

    void Fax();

    void Scan();
}
 ```
 lets implement the class in a all in one printer.it work just fine.



``` JAVA                   
   class AllInOnePrinter : ISmartDevice
{
    public void Print()
    {
         // Printing code.
    }

    public void Fax()
    {
         // Beep booop biiiiip.
    }

    public void Scan()
    {
         // Scanning code.
    }
}          
  ```

 Now the client comes with an Electronic printer which can ony Print.FAX and Scan functionality is not there in the printer.lets see what happens  when we inherit the Electronic Printer class  from  ISmartdevice class.see the code below.

 ```JAVA 
         class EconomicPrinter : ISmartDevice
{
    public void Print()
    {
        //Yes I can print.
    }

    public void Fax()
    {
        throw new NotSupportedException();
    }

    public void Scan()
    {
        throw new NotSupportedException();
    }
}
```
   Here the client is forced to implement functions that he never use.so this is a violation of ISP.a better way of design is given below.

 ```JAVA
interface IPrinter{
    void Print();
}

interface IFax{
    void Fax();
}

interface IScanner{
    void Scan();
}  
```
here each interface is separated.this make the reuse more flexible and client  do not have to worry about implementing irrelevant logic in the design.so its always better to create small interfaces with single functionality rather than creating big interface with lots of methods.doing this way  make the code more easier to maintain and  provides improved flexibility.


## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

statement for this principle can be written as

>  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

to understand above statements les's  understand the definition of each word

* high level module-A high-level module is a module that always depends on other modules




according this principle High-Level modules and low level modules should be loosely coupled or de-coupled.both class shouldn't depend on each other.


```java

     class MySQLConnection
{
    public function connect()
    {
        // handle the database connection
        return 'Database connection';
    }
}

class PasswordReminder
{
    private $dbConnection;

    public function __construct(MySQLConnection $dbConnection)
    {
        $this->dbConnection = $dbConnection;
    }
}
    
   ```


First, the MySQLConnection is the low-level module while the PasswordReminder is high level, but
This snippet above violates this principle as the PasswordReminder class is being forced to depend on the MySQLConnection class.

Later, if you were to change the database engine, you would also have to edit the PasswordReminder class, and this would violate the open-close principle.

The PasswordReminder class should not care what database your application uses. To address these issues, you can code to an interface since high-level and low-level modules should depend on abstraction:


The PasswordReminder class should not care what database your application uses. To address these issues, you can code to an interface since high-level and low-level modules should depend on abstraction:

```JAVA
interface DBConnectionInterface
{
    public function connect();
}
```




The interface has a connect method and the MySQLConnection class implements this interface. Also, instead of directly type-hinting MySQLConnection class in the constructor of the PasswordReminder, you instead type-hint the DBConnectionInterface and no matter the type of database your application uses, the PasswordReminder class can connect to the database without any problems and open-close principle is not violated.

```JAVA
          class MySQLConnection implements DBConnectionInterface
{
    public function connect()
    {
        // handle the database connection
        return 'Database connection';
    }
}

class PasswordReminder
{
    private $dbConnection;

    public function __construct(DBConnectionInterface $dbConnection)
    {
        $this->dbConnection = $dbConnection;
    }
}

 ```

 This code establishes that both the high-level and low-level modules depend on abstraction.



 ## CONCLUSION
 In this article, you were presented with the five principles of SOLID Code. Projects that adhere to SOLID principles can be shared with collaborators, extended, modified, tested, and refactored with fewer complications.
